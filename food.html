                see a stack of locals lined up at every kushari shop around, waiting
                for a hearty portion of one of Egypt’s favourite street foods.<br> This
                filling meal is made up of rice, macaroni and lentils, topped with
                tomato sauce, garlic vinegar and garnished with chickpeas and fried
                onions. It’s a perfect meal that is substantial, nutrient-packed and
                cheap. Exactly what the Egyptians were after!

            <p>

                Ta’meya and ful mudammas, which are essentially fava beans and
                falafel are the original Egyptian fast-foods. They’re a staple of
                the Egyptian diet, mainly because they’re filling and use
                ingredients that are easily accessible in the country.<br> The ful is
                made of fava beans that are cooked for hours in a pot called a
                qedra.
                The ta-meya, which is an Egyptian falafel, is made out of
                crushed fava beans that is later made into a paste, then fried.
                Nowadays you can find falafels all over the Middle East however,
                Egypt is the actual origin of those delightful fried treats. A
                perfect dish for all you vegos!
